# Automated-Identify---SEO-Spam---TFIDF-Vectorizer-MultinomialNB-Sklearn


Requirements:
Numpy
Pandas
Pylab
sklearn

Objective: 

Identify the spam websites and pirated movies websites using certain techniques to extract features from text. Count - Vectorizer extracts features based on word count. Then deploying the feature-vectors such as to Multinomial Naive bayes Classifier to classify Spam website/ Non Spam websites. TFIDF Vectorizer extracts features based on word count giving less weightage to frequent words and more weigtage to rare words.

Note: 
Training a large data set takes very longer time, due to time constrains. I have prepared dataset limited around 150 count. This is for demonstration purpose, Hence I have used less data set to test it and it works sucessfully! :D
